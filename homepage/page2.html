            My name is Kiran Mishra, and I am a Sophmore and Nest+m. I started to play football starting this year in July I started to play Tackle Football for the Nyc Lions. Playing for the lions has had many positive impacts on my life and I am very glad to be on this team. We preactice at East River Park on the Lower East Side, which is very close to Nest+,m. I play the position Offensive and Defnesive Tackle, so on Defense I attack the quarterback and try to tackle him or the runningback, and on Offense I protect the quarterback and open up gaps for the runningback to run through. At first, I did not get much play time and was often on the bench and only played on kickoff or kick return. But as I progressed throughout the season I started to play more and eventually got a starting spot at right tackle. Playing for the Lions has had a very postive impact on my life as it taught me resilence, discipline, and has brought me many great connections with teamates and coaches.
